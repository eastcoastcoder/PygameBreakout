# PygameBreakout
#Description
Breakout! is essentially single player Pong.  The player controls a paddle with an independant ball moving on the screen.  The goal is to keep this ball bouncing and destorying layers of bricks until all the bricks have been removed.  The player scores points for every brick removed.

#Goals
Use arrays and collision detection to handle collisions across multiple obstacles

#Specifications
 - Create appropriate classes for the Ball, Paddle and Breakable Boxes.  This is a good opportunity to practice inheritence
 - The player paddle should be controlled via keyboard
 - Breakable Boxes should have a number of hitpoints (1, 2 or 3) and give appropriate feedback to the user (ie: change their color)
